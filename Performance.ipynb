    "So we learned that overhead matters. In fact, it can matter so much that you might not even want to use your parallelized program version. In general we can say that the bigger the problem size, the more likely it will be worth it using parallelization. In the case of sorting algorithms, the problem size can be increased by increasing the list length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look again at the quicksort algorithm. This time we are going to use the parallel quicksort with 64 threads to sort different lengths of lists. We want to find out how long our list has to be, so that it is worth it to use the parallel implementation with 64 threads. You can find the code for the graph below in the notebook ['./extras/overhead'](./extras/overhead.ipynb).\n",

    "We can see that for all list length smaller than 2'900 we get a speed-up smaller 1. Thus it only makes sense for us to use the parallel implementation of quicksort with 64 threads if our list is at least 2'900 elements long. The reason for this is parallel overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** It is a common technique in parallel programming to set a threshold for when to use the serial implementation instead of the parallel one [[10]](#k). In our example we would set the threshold to 2'900. If the list length is smaller than the threshold, a serial implementation of the algorithm can be used, otherwise a parallel one. This is especially useful in 'divide and conquer' algorithms, where the problem size often changes with each internal call of the function. To set a good value for the threshold you can do the kind of analysis I did with the quicksort algorithm."

    "**Limitations of Amdahl' Law**:  \n",
    "- Amdahl's Law does not give us any information about what happens if we vary the problem size. Do you remember the graphic we calculated in the section about overhead? There we saw that the problem size has an influence on speed-up. The larger the list of random numbers to be sorted by quicksort, the more speed-up could we observe (while keeping the thread number constant). Amdahl's law fails to look into the effects of varying problem sizes. \n",
    "- Amdahl's Law assumes that all parallel regions use the same amount of threads. In practice this is not always the case. Each parallel region might have a different amount of threads. Another common scenario is to have a loop, and a different amount of threads for each run of the loop. The upper-bound for speed-up calculated with Amdahl's Law is still correct in these cases, because we only give an 'upper-bound'. However, we could give a more precise upper-bound by adjusting the formula of Amdahl's Law so that it considers different amount of threads for different parallel regions. \n",
    "- Amdahl's Law only gives an upper bound for speed-up. It does not give an approximation for the true speed-up. The speed-up we end up measuring can vary greatly from the one that is in theory possible (if there is no parallel overhead and if all parallel regions use the same amount of threads). \n",
    "- Amdahl's Law assumes that f is fixed. In practice however, we can observe that the ration of the parallelizable part of the program to the non-parallelizable one changes, as we change the problem size. If we want to calculate the upper-bound of speed-up for various problem sizes, Amdahl's Law is not suitable (unless we change f for each calculation).\n",

    "\n",
    "Have you wondered how you would be able to find out what fraction of the program is inherently serial? If you want to use Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law for calculations you need to know `f` (the serial fraction of the program). \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get f is by measuring the wall time of all the program parts which you believe to be non-parallelizable, and the wall time of the parts which you believe can be parallelized. Doing this will give you a rough idea about the value of f. The challenge with this approach is to get all the serial parts together that are hiding within the parallel region. Let's say you have a code block which is executed by only one thread, then you have to add that to the serial execution time, even if the code lies within a region that can be parallelized. It can be challenging and time consuming to find all the code blocks which belong to the non-parallelizable part of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of calculating f is by using Amdahl's Law. \n",
    "We know from Amdahl's Law that if we keep the problem size fixed, and we measure the execution time with an increasing number of threads, then the maximum speed-up will diverge towards $\\frac{1}{f}$. Do you already see where this goes?\n",

    "We can visually analyze what an approximate value for the maximum possible speed-up could be for an infinite number of processing units. This gives us a value for $\\frac{1}{f}$. Calculating f is then really easy, as $\\frac{1/f}{1} = f$. So all we have to do is find out the limit that the graph is diverging to, and divide that value by 1. Instead of doing the analysis visually we can also use some fancy python modules that allow us to fit a graph to a set of data points and then we can calculate the limit of that graph for an infinite number of p. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** You can try this method with any of the programs in the `./programs` folder. Just open the notebook ['compare_timemeasuring_methods'](./extras/compare_timemeasuring_methods.ipynb)  in the folder `./extras` and calculate the speed-up progression for the program you are interested in. Try to figure out what f could be.\n",

    "You might notice two interesting things:\n",
    "1. If we measure the execution time on the algorithm only instead of the full program run, it is much harder for us to guess what the maximum possible speed-up for an infinite number of threads could be. \n",
    "2. The speed-up progression is most of the time not monotonously increasing. Instead it often drops again with a higher number of threads. \n",

    "The speed-up progression for the Mandelbrot-set program in the picture above is based on measurements made on the full program run. How does the graphic look if we measure execution time on the algorithm only? Here is the graphic:\n",

    "<img src='figures/Mandelbrot_algorithmOnly.PNG' width='400' art='Mandelbrot....\"'> \n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like we get a linear speed-up progression, but Amdahl's Law has taught us that this is not possible if the problem size is fixed. The reason why we don't see a logarithmic curve is that we don't have enough threads available. If we had a more powerful machine that allowed to use more than 64 threads, we would eventually notice a logarithmic curve pattern (if the number of threads is high enough). Because the fraction of the inherently serial part of the program is much smaller if we measure the execution time on the algorithm only, we can achieve much higher speed-up. Further, it takes a higher amount of threads until we can see the curve flattening. You can test this out yourself if you go to the section of Amdahl's Law. There you see some [code](#codeamdahl) with which you can create the graph of Amdahl's Law with different values for f. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second observation is that when we actually measure the execution time of our program with different thread numbers and plot the results, we might get very different results than what Amdahl's Law would make us believe we should get. The reason for this is parallel overhead. Amdahl's Law does not account for any parallel overhead, which is why we only get an 'upper bound' for speed-up. The actual speed-up however, can vary greatly from the upper bound of speed-up calculated with Amdahl's Law. If the parallel overhead is a constant value for any thread number, then we get a curve that resembles the curve we can calculate with Amdahl's Law. Anyhow, most of the time the parallel overhead is not a constant value, but grows as the number of threads grows. \n",

We have to be careful not to confuse the true speed-up with the speed-up that would in theory be possible if there was no parallel overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another possible method to calculate f is with one or multiple speed-up measurements. With Amdahl's Law we can calculate an upper bound for speed-up: $\\frac{1}{f+\\frac{(1-f)}{p}}$. If we isolate f, we get $f = \\frac{p - s}{s \\cdot (p-1)}$ with s=upper bound for speed-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean we can just do any measurement for speed-up, plug it into the formula just mentioned and get f? \n",
    "This will not work because of two reasons:\n",
    "1. Random Noise: If we calculate f with the formula above with different measurements, we will always get a different value for f. \n",
    "2. Difference between upper-bound and true speed-up: By now you should know that Amdahl's Law gives us only an upper bound for speed-up, not the actual speed-up. The method just mentioned would work fine if you knew the upper bound for speed-up. But you don't. You only know the true speed-up. Therefore, the f you calculate with this method is not the true f. The upper bound for speed-up for a certain thread number is higher than the actual speed-up you measured. Therefore, the true f is smaller than the f you end up calculating, when you plug the 'measured speed-up' into the formula above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** There is not one satisfying method to calculate f. Depending on the program one or the other method will be most suitable.

According to the above definition you can only say that your program \"scales strongly\", if the efficiency remains the same despite increasing the thread number. Even though you analyze a program for strong scalability, most likely you will come to the conclusion that the program does not \"scale strongly\". That is because you always have a part of the program which is inherently serial. Amdahl's Law has shown us that speed-up cannot be linear but diverges towards $\\frac{1}{f}$ instead. Therefore the efficiency will never remain fixed (compare with the [graphic](#codeamdahl) we calculated in the previous section about efficiency). What this indicates is that a program can never achieve \"strong scalability\". \n",

Anyhow, when we say that a program \"scales weakly\", it does by no means indicates poor scalability. According to [[2]](#j) a program that achieves \"weak scalability\" scales \"poorly\", if we have to increase the problem size exponentially in order to maintain the efficiency fixed. On the other hand, if we have a program where we only need to increase the problem size with a linear function in order to maintain the efficiency fixed, then we have a program with \"weak scalability\" that scales \"highly\".

The result is that we get better speed-up when we increase the problem size. As we have just seen in the example of the matrix matrix multiplication with 32 threads, this theory is not always right.

In order to calculate speed-up and efficiency it is necessary to measure the execution time of the serial and parallel program. A task that seems simple, but can bring up a lot of questions too. We looked into different methods of measuring execution time, and how these can influence the speed-up and efficiency we end up calculating. \n",

No matter how small the inherently serial part 'f' of the program is, and no matter how many parallel processing units we have, we will never be able to achieve a speed-up beyond a certain limit. That limit is 1/f. We can only use Amdahl's law to calculate an upper bound for speed-up if we know the fraction of the program that is inherently serial.We can get an approximate value for 'f' by measuring the wall time of different program parts, or by analyzing the speed-up progression of a program with the knowledge we gained from Amdahl's Law.\n",

In weak scaling we can often achieve higher speed-up, even with a large number of threads.

    "\n",
    "You might want to reread one or the other passages. Many things will make much more sense in the second read. Another thing I would suggest to you is looking at the notebooks in the `./extra` folder. These allow you to play around with different programs, and investigate how the change in threads and/or problem size influence execution time, speed-up and efficiency. You can also use these notebooks to analyze your own parallelized programs. More about this you can find in the `./readme.txt` file. \n",
